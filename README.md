# Deep Reinforcement Learning method for Cassie
This project is about training the bipedal robot Cassie to walk around using the DRL method. The training is deployed on MJX (GPU Accelerated platform of MuJoCo) using BRAX as the training package.

The insight of this project is using a GPU-accelerated training method which significantly improved the training efficiency and reduced the hardware requirements. The initial training environment (hardware) is RTX4060 Laptop.
